Simple examples of pygame. **Just for fun**.

The only dependency, for now, is pygame

`pip install pygame`

### paralax_city.py

*Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics 
where background images move past the camera more slowly 
than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth 
in a 2D scene and adding to the sense of immersion in 
the virtual experience.[1] The technique grew out of 
the multiplane camera technique used in traditional 
animation since the 1930s.* From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling)

This example programmatically creates a moving background with three layers.

To run:

```python
python paralax_city.py
```
